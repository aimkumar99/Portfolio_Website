      <section class="about_me" id="about_me">
        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>With nearly four years of experience in civil engineering, I have gained valuable knowledge in road construction and buildings. My career has been dedicated to transforming detailed plans into functional and reliable infrastructure. From initial site surveys to the final stages of construction, I apply technical precision and a comprehensive understanding of engineering principles to ensure each project meets the highest standards of quality and safety. My work in road construction focuses on creating efficient and durable transportation networks, while my experience with building projects emphasizes structural integrity and usability.

          <br>Throughout my career, I have successfully managed teams and coordinated complex projects, ensuring timely completion and adherence to budget constraints. My approach combines meticulous attention to detail with effective project management skills, resulting in infrastructure that serves the communityâ€™s needs and stands the test of time. I am committed to continuous improvement and innovation in my field, striving to deliver projects that not only fulfill current requirements but also anticipate future demands.</p>
          
        <h2>Research Interests:</h2>
        <h3>1. Structural Dynamic Systems:</h3>
        <p>As a civil engineering student, I find researching structural dynamics systems incredibly important. Understanding how structures respond to dynamic forces like earthquakes, wind, and vibrations is crucial for designing safe and resilient buildings. This knowledge helps me optimize designs, ensure safety, and improve performance, especially in high seismic zones like Nepal. By delving into structural dynamics, I can contribute to creating infrastructure that withstands dynamic loads, ultimately protecting lives and reducing economic losses.</p>
        <h3>2. Seismic Response Control:</h3>
        <p>I understand that seismic response control is vital for ensuring the safety and integrity of buildings and infrastructure, especially in high seismic zones like Nepal. By reducing the impact of seismic forces, we can protect lives and minimize injuries during earthquakes. Effective seismic response control also lowers repair costs and economic losses, making our structures more resilient. Utilizing advanced technologies such as base isolators and dampers, we can absorb and dissipate seismic energy, ensuring that our buildings remain functional even after significant seismic events. This knowledge is crucial for developing safer, more sustainable infrastructure in earthquake-prone areas.</p>
        <h3>3. Structural Health Monitoring:</h3>
        <p>Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) enhances the safety and reliability of structures by detecting damage early. It reduces maintenance costs and extends the lifespan of infrastructure.
         </p>
        <h3>4. Solid Mechanics:</h3>       
        <p>In solid mechanics, I am interested in exploring how solid materials behave under various forces and moments. This field will help me understand stress, strain, and deformation in structures, ensuring they remain stable and safe. I am eager to delve into concepts like elasticity, where materials return to their original shape after being deformed, and plasticity, where they undergo permanent changes. By analyzing beams, trusses, and other structures, I will be able to predict how they will respond to different loads, ensuring they donâ€™t fail under pressure. This knowledge is  crucial for designing safe and efficient buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.</p>
           <h3>5. Composite Materials:</h3>
        <p>Composite materials in civil engineering are crucial because they offer high strength-to-weight ratios, corrosion resistance, and durability, enhancing infrastructure performance and longevity. This research enables innovative, efficient, and sustainable construction practices, meeting modern demands while minimizing environmental impact.</p>
